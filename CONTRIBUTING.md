# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Commit Process

This repository utilizes the [Conventional Commits Standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) which provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history and in-turn makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

A Git Hook is provided to enforce this behavior on `commit-msg`

## Pull Request Process

To contribute to Sage development you must be an authorized contributor, typically as an employee of Kajabi. Otherwise:

* Create a branch off of `develop` on which to add your changes. Push the branch and open a PR.
* Once approval has been given, merge the PR into `develop`. Ensure your commit history accurately represents the changes made to the invidivual packages.
* *Do not* Squash and Merge your history into one commit. Automated Changelogs are generated based on the commit messages you supply to individual package directories. If you squash the changes the changelog will no longer reflect accurate adjustments to the system.
