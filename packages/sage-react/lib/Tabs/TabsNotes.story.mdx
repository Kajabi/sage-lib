Tabs allow a simplified tab interface where the `tabs` prop can be provided an array of items that follow this structure:

- `id` -- a unique HTML id attribute for the tab.
- `label` -- label to appear on the tab.
- `subtext` -- option subtext available for the `choice` tab style.
- `content` -- rich content to contain on the tab pane, this should contain JSX content. If a particular container is not inherent in this content, use `React.fragment` as opposed to additional wrapping `div`s.

The tabs interface handles changing tabs on its own, but there are additional options to consider:

- `onClickTab` is an optional function which, if provided, will override the internal click handler. The `id` for the clicked tab is provided to this function.
- `onChangeTabHook` is an optional hook that can be called alongside the internal click handler. The `id` for the clicked tab is provided to this function.

While the Tabs component is set up to make the first tab selected by default, you can pass a different tab's `id` to `initialActiveId`. This is helpful in the case that you have interactive controls inside a tab pane that govern navigation between tabs.

To adjust display settings for the panes within Tabs, you have three options:

- `card` -- set this to `true` to display the pane as a card with layout rules and border settings to match (for when the Tabs component is within a Panel and the selected Pane should appear as a Card).
- `cardSpacing` -- set this to `true` to display the pane with card layout rules but not internal padding or border (for when the entire Tabs component is directly within a Panel).
- `panelSpacing` -- set this to `true` to display the pane with panel layout rules but not internal padding or box shadow (for when the entire Tabs component is directly within a Panel).
