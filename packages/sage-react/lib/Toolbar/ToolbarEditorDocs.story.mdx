Toolbar Editor is a container for grouping a set of controls, such as `<Button />`s and `<Dropdown />`s.

You'll need to wrap toolbar sections in `<ToolbarEditor />`s inside of a `flexbox` container to receive the desired visual treatment.
For sections that are not intended to have the responsive behavior, set `isFixed={true}`.


## Button types
#### Rich Text Editor Button
The default toolbar editor button has an icon only treatment.

<Canvas>
  <Button
    color="secondary"
    className="sage-btn--rich-text"
    selected={true}
    icon="strikethrough"
    iconOnly={true}>Button
  </Button>
</Canvas>

#### Rich Text Editor Dropdown Button with Icon
This variant of the toolbar edit button is a icon-only dropdown button.

<Canvas>
  <Button 
    color="secondary"
    children="Text"
    className="sage-btn--rich-text"
    icon="align-left"
    iconOnly={true}
    disclosure={true}>Text
  </Button>
</Canvas>

#### Rich Text Editor Dropdown Button
There are cases when text is shown instead of the icon.

<Canvas>
  <Button 
    color="secondary"
    children="Text"
    className="sage-btn--rich-text"
    disclosure={true}>Text
  </Button>
</Canvas>

## Selected buttons
Add the `selected` attribute to your `<SageButton />`s to receive the selected treatment.

## Responsive behavior
<!-- TODO: add Loom -->

One of the responsive features of the `<ToolbarEditor />` is to utilize the Priority Plus navigation pattern,
which hides items within a dropdown when space is no longer available. The `<ToolbarEditor />` dropdown will contain a `add` icon
unless only the dropdown is present. In that case the icon if the first item will be displayed.

#### `isFixed`
The `isFixed` property toggles the responsive behavior and `add` `icon` dropdown for the `<ToolbarEditor> />`.

When `true`
- the sections expand and contract based available space of the parent container.
- Items cannot fit the container width will be added the `add` `icon` dropdown's items

When `false`
- the sections will **NOT** expand or contract and will be fixed to the width of the inner elements.
- The `add` `icon` dropdown functionality is removed. You are still able to manually add a dropdown, but it has no relationship to the wrapping `<ToolbarEditor />`

## Structure
To achieve our responsive pattern, `<ToolbarEditor />` requires:
- No item in a flexible `<ToolbarEditor />` can contain a dropdown. This will cause a dropdown to reside in the `<ToolbarEditor />` dropdown when adequate space is not available.
- No item can be nested multiple levels. All items must be direct children of the group.

Below is the desired structure for a flexible `<ToolbarEditor />`:
```
<ToolbarEditor>
  <Button>...</Button>
  <Button>...</Button>
</ToolbarEditor>
```

#### Implementation guidelines

These groups contain a specific order and responsive restrictions detailed below. The line in the graphic seperates
the fixed items (1-3) from the flexible items (4-6):
1. Text formating group
    - `isFixed={true}`
    - Single item
    - Item contains a custom class, `.rich-text__format-button`, to handle responsive behavior of text and icon replacement
2. Font formatting group
    - `isFixed={true}`
    - 3 items, with the last being a dropdown with 6 items
3. Color picker group
    - `isFixed={true}`
    - Single item
4. List options group - Flexible
    - Flexible
    - 2 items
    - Only room for one icon, but the down chevron indicate more button commands available
5. Alignment options group
    - Flexible
    - 4 items
    - standard `<ToolbarEditor />` that will expand and collapse based on available width. Plus sign icon indicates that there are items, unless there is only room for one. See description in the List options group above
6. Remaining options group
    - Flexible
    - This space is meant for the rest of your items
    - standard `<ToolbarEditor />` that will expand and collapse based on available width. Plus sign icon indicates that there are items, unless there is only room for one. See description in the List options group above
