<Meta title="Sage/Panel/Panel Tiles Notes" />

`Panel.Tiles` can be used when a set of elements should be laid out in a repeating, tiling fashion within a Panel.

- Tiles can be set to tile up with 2, 3, or 4 in a row using `tilesInRow`
- Tile items can be provided through the `tiles` prop or a set of elements can be passed directly as `children`.
- When `tiles` are provided you can also have them automatically wrapped as `Panel.Tile` elements by passing `wrapTiles={true}`. You do not need this if the items have their own wrapping elements, such as if they are Cards.
- Finally, items can be provided a consistent `tileClassName` for additional organization or consistent styling.
