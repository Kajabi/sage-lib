<Meta title="Sage/DataCard/Card Notes" />

Data Cards format a small amount of content into a neatly contained card-like frame.

The Panel is a compositional component that allows the following additional options:

- `Panel.Header` -- Contains header content such as the panel title separated from `Body` but a clean border. THis may contain any element, but a simple single element is recommended.
- `Panel.HeaderAside` -- (must be placed within `Header`) Provides a container for an icon or option menu that is aligned to the right of the `Header`.
- `Panel.Body` -- This is minimally necessary for appropriately spaced content. Any contant can be placed within the `Body`.
