<Meta title="Sage/DataCard/Card Scroll Notes" />

Data Cards can also be configured inline with a sideways scrolling and titles of each group.

- Add `DataCard.ScrollContainer` around a set of Panels.
- Optionally, a `title` to each `DataCard.Group` along with `titleTag` as needed in order to markup and style this title as desired.
