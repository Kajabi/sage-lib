# Button

Buttons are used to perform actions within a page or view.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to use

- Communicating an action that will occur. (e.g. saving a page)
- Triggering or enabling an action, such as submitting requested information. (e.g. forms)
- Progressing or regressing a user through a step in a flow. (e.g. modals)

### When not to use

- Directing users to a new page or different part within the same page. Instead, use [Link](/docs/sage-link--primary).

## Accessibility

When following our usage guidelines, the button should be accessible right out of the box but there are still a few general accessibility best practices to make sure you follow:

- Buttons should always contain helpful text about what they do even if this text is expected to be visually hidden. (e.g. "Submit Form" or "Delete Account")
- Buttons should not disable tabbing or keyboard navigation.
