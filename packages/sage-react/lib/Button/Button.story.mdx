Sage Buttons allow a number of modifiers to customize their appearance including:

- Color -- use `color` prop; default is `primary`
- Size -- use `size` prop; default is standard size (40px)
- Alignment -- option to align to the right with `alignRight` set to `true`
- Icons -- All Sage icons can be added either to the left or the right of the button label using `icon` and `iconPosition` (left is default). You can even make an icon-only button with `iconOnly` set to `true` in which case the label becomes visually hidden leaving just the icon visible while still screen reader accessible.

A variation of the Copy Button can be created with the Button component. This can be achieved by creating a Sage Button and passing in the `data-js-copy-button` attribute.

Buttons can also be configured as hyperlinks while keeping the styling consistent. Just pass the desired properties (at least `href`) for external links or `to` for route-based links (must be within React Router components). Additional HTML attributes and `Link` props may also be passed as needed.

When two or more buttons need to be grouped together use `Button.Group` to wrap them. Use the `gap` prop to adjust the spacing as needed. The group can also be set to align to the right with `alignEnd={true}` if needed.
