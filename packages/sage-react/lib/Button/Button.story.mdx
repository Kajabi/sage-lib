Sage Buttons allow a number of modifiers to customize their appearance including:

- Color -- use `color` prop; default is `primary`
- Size -- use `size` prop; default is standard size (40px)
- Alignment -- option to align to the right with `alignRight` set to `true`
- Icons -- All Sage icons can be added either to the left or the right of the button label using `icon` and `iconPosition` (left is default). You can even make an icon-only button with `iconOnly` set to `true` in which case the label becomes visually hidden leaving just the icon visible while still screen reader accessible.

Buttons can also be configured as hyperlinks while keeping the styling consistent. Just pass the desired properties (at least `href`) for external links or `to` for route-based links (must be within React Router components). Additional HTML attributes and `Link` props may also be passed as needed.

When two or more buttons need to be grouped together use `Button.Group` to wrap them. Use the `gap` prop to adjust the spacing as needed. The group can also be set to align to the right with `alignEnd={true}` if needed.
