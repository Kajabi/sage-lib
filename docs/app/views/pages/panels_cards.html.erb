## Organizing within Sage

Within Sage, we aim to keep our content organized well while avoiding additional unsemantic markup.
It is always preferable to use simple structures over complex ones
and to use HTML tags as they are intended.
When it comes to organizing markup such as `div` and the `section` tags, in particular,
care should be taken to use each in its intended context.
When in doubt, `div` is the preferred default organizer in order to avoid confuscating organization
with the additional semantics and outlining features of the `section` tags.

Our grid setup and containers provide a baseline for sizing elements
and displaying them in particular arrangements beside each other.
But when it comes to visual effects that enhance grouping we have two core categories
of grouping devices: Panels and Cards.

## Panels

Panels may be placed on the Stage and present a group of content
within a raised white background with rounded corners.

Panels are very versatile with a number of inner elements useful
for arranging content as desired.
These are explained in full detail on the
[Panel Component](/pages/component/panel) page.

## Cards

Cards are smaller sets of content placed within Panels that have a solid border,
rounded corner treatment, and certain internal spacing rules.

Implementation of Cards are almost infinite,
but formally codified configurations are found under Components
such as Upload Cards, Data Cards, and Expandable Cards.
For other one-off implementations, the
[Card Component](/pages/component/card)
can be used (assumedly within a panel).
