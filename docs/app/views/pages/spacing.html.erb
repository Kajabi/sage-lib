## Coloring Type

While applying colors to type on-the-fly should generally be avoided
we do provide the following utility classes for such cases where its most practical:

  We use several different "tiers" of spacings as follows:

  - Application-level: `32px` -- this is the outermost tier where foundational page elements such as the page heading and any organizing panels are contained.
  - Panel-level: `24px` -- this is next layer in where groups of elements are presented with a slight smaller internal spacing.
    This may be distinct panels or groups of content similar to such panels.
  - Card-level: `16px` -- card components or smaller groups of content recieve this smaller spacing.
  - Stack-level: `8px` -- stacks of content that are visually groups such as blocks of paragraphs or list items get this smallest spacing.

  A `spacer` attribute is available on all Sage Rails components that can apply a spacing value to any side of an element (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`).
  Usage works like this:

```erb
\<\%\= sage_component SageButton, { value: "Sample", spacer: { top: "xs", bottom: "lg" }} \%\>
```
  )) %>
  <%= sage_component SageButton, { style: "primary", value: "Sample", spacer: { top: "xs", bottom: "lg" }} %>
  <%= md(%(
    Finally, beyond component attributes, the `SageClassnames` module makes these same spacer classes available anywhere.

    In Rails:

```erb
<b class="\<\%\= SageClassnames::SPACERS::LG_TOP \%\>">I have extra space above!</b>
```

  In React:

```jsx
<b className={SageClassnames.SPACERS.LG_TOP}>I have extra space above!</b>
```
  )) %>
</div>
