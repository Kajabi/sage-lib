# Typography
<p class="docs-heading__lead">
Sage provides a constrained, purposeful set of typographic styles.
These styles map as much as possible to functional roles so you know when each can be used.
</p>

Setting individual styles manually should be avoided, but where needed, should be sure to use the appropriate
[design tokens](/pages/foundations/token).
In the end, we prefer adding new entries to the type spec over including one-off styling.

      The Sage type system uses a loose major second modular scale (factor of 1.125) derived from an initial base font size of 14px. However, for improved readability with mobile / small screen devices, this base font size is increased to 16px.

      Typography in our system uses `t-sage-` classes in order to apply a given typographical specification to an element
      These can be used on any element to apply the desired typographical styles regardless of the tag. This allows a
      wide range of flexibility for applying a desired style to an element while still using the most semantic element possible
      for a given context.

\* The `t-sage-body{-size}` classes also have weight variations:
append `-med` for <span class="t-sage-body-med">medium (500)</span>;
append `-semi` for <span class="t-sage-body-semi">semibold (600)</span>;
append `-bold` for <span class="t-sage-body-bold">bold (700)</span>

The type specs above map logically to corresponding HTML elements, as well as the following:

- Body (`t-sage-body`) is used as the default type style, and is thus applied to elements such as
  `li`, `dd`, `td`, `blockquote`, and more.
- <strong>Body Bold</strong> (`t-sage-body-semi`) is used for elements that are typically bolded such as
  `tr`, `dt`, `strong`, and `b`.

As an example, see here how the \"Heading 3\" type spec can be applied to an `h3` element:
') %>

  <h3 class="t-sage-heading-3">Lorem ipsum dolor sit</h3>
  <div class="sage-code-snippet">
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;h3 class="t-sage-heading-3"&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>
  </div>

    <%= md("
      But the exact specs can also be applied to any element such as a `span`.
      This is not meant to be an excuse for using non-semantic markup, but rather,
      to free a spec to be applied to the most semantic element in context regardless
      of the spec's name.

      For setting text in open areas where simpler markup is desired, or where a
      content management system controls the markup being output, we recommend applying
      the `sage-type` class on a container around such content. This
      leads to some default styling applied to the tags within the container

## Coloring Type

While applying colors to type on-the-fly should generally be avoided
we do provide the following utility classes for such cases where its most practical:
