Description:
  Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design systemâ€”specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

Example:
  rails generate sage_token <new_token_name>

  This will create:
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/tokens/_<new_token_name>.scss (stylesheet for token)

  This will update:
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/tokens/_index.scss (imports new token stylesheet)

  Note that <root>/docs/app/helpers/tokens_helper.rb will *not* be updated and must be manually updated.
