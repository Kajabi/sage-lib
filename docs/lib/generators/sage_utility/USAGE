Description:
  Utilities are classes be used to accomplish specific styling needs and _should be used sparingly_, these limited use classes are designed to give the system flexibility but not meant to contribute to inconsistency.

Example:
  rails generate sage_utility <new_utility_name>

  This will create:
    <root>/docs/app/views/examples/utilities/<new_utility_name>/_preview.html.erb (documentation preview and description)
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/utilities/_<new_utility_name>.scss (stylesheet for new utility)

  This will update:
    <root>/docs/app/helpers/utilities_helper.rb (utility registry)
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/index.scss (imports utility stylesheet)
