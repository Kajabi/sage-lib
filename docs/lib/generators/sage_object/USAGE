Description:
  Objects are groups of elements bonded together. These Objects take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

Example:
  rails generate sage_component <new_object_name>

  This will create:
    <root>/docs/app/views/examples/objects/<new_object_name>/_preview.html.erb (documentation preview and description)
    <root>/docs/app/views/examples/objects/<new_object_name>/_props.html.erb (object property documentation)
    <root>/docs/app/views/examples/objects/<new_object_name>/_rules_do.html.erb ("do" quick usage tips for object)
    <root>/docs/app/views/examples/objects/<new_object_name>/_rules_dont.html.erb ("don't" quick usage tips for object)
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/patterns/objects/_<new_object_name>.scss (stylesheet for object)

  This will update:
    <root>/docs/app/helpers/objects_helper.rb (objects registry)
    <root>/packages/sage-assets/lib/stylesheets/index.scss (imports object stylesheet)
