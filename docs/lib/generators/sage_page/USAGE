Description:
  Pages refer to the pages of the Sage Design System Gem. Before creating a new page, make sure that what you are documenting would not be a better fit in the gem wiki.

Example:
  rails generate sage_page <new_page_name>

  This will create:
    <root>/docs/app/views/pages/<new_page_name>.html.erb
